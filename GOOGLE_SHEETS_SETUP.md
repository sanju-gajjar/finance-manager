## Step 5: Configure Your App

### 5.1 Prepare JSON Key

3. **Make it a single line** - remove all line breaks and spaces between keys

### 5.2 Create .env File
```bash
# In your project directory, copy the example
cp .env.example .env
```

### 5.3 Edit .env File
```bash
# Replace with your actual values:

GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=1BxiMVs0XRA5nFMdKvBdBZjgmUUqptlbs74OgvE2upms
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY={"type":"service_account","project_id":"family-expense-tracker-401234","private_key_id":"abc123...","private_key":"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIEvQIBADANBgkq...","client_email":"expense-tracker-service@family-expense-tracker-401234.iam.gserviceaccount.com","client_id":"123456789","auth_uri":"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth","token_uri":"https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token","auth_provider_x509_cert_url":"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs","client_x509_cert_url":"https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/expense-tracker-service%40family-expense-tracker-401234.iam.gserviceaccount.com"}

PORT=3002
NODE_ENV=development
```

**ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT NOTES:**
- The JSON key must be on ONE single line in the .env file
- Don't share your .env file - it contains sensitive credentials
- Add .env to .gitignore (already done)

## Step 6: Test the Setup

### 6.1 Start Your App
```bash
npm start
```

### 6.2 Add a Test Expense
1. Open http://localhost:3002
2. Add a test expense
3. Check your Google Sheet - you should see a new "Expenses" tab created
4. Your expense should appear in the sheet!

### 6.3 Troubleshooting
If it doesn't work:

**Error: "sheets is not defined"**
- Check your GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY in .env
- Make sure it's valid JSON on one line

**Error: "Permission denied"**
- Make sure you shared the sheet with the service account email
- Set permission to "Editor", not "Viewer"

**Error: "Sheet not found"**
- Double-check your GOOGLE_SHEET_ID
- Make sure the sheet exists and is accessible

## ðŸŽ‰ Success!

Once working, your expenses will:
âœ… Save locally on your phone (works offline)  
âœ… Automatically sync to Google Sheets when online  
âœ… Be accessible from any device via Google Sheets  
âœ… Have automatic backup and version history  

You can now view and manage your expense data directly in Google Sheets, create additional reports, or share with family members!
